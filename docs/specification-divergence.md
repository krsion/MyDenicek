# Why mydenicek Diverged from the Original Specification

## Executive Summary

The [original specification](../documents/specification/specification.pdf)[^1]
describes a system built on **Loro CRDTs** with ID-addressed nodes, a
Loro-managed undo/redo system, automatic recording via Loro event subscriptions,
and a formula engine embedded in the node model. The actual `mydenicek`
implementation[^2] took a fundamentally different architectural path: it uses a
**custom OT-based event DAG with vector clocks**, path-addressed selectors,
explicit edit types with hand-written transformation rules, a custom undo/redo
mechanism based on inverse events, and a formula evaluation engine. This
document justifies each architectural divergence, maps every specification
requirement to the current implementation status, and identifies the few
features that remain missing.

## 1. Fundamental Architectural Shift: Loro CRDTs → Custom OT Event DAG

### What the specification says

The specification prescribes Loro[^3] as the CRDT substrate. Nodes are addressed
by unique IDs (`TreeID` from `LoroTree`), conflict resolution delegates to
Loro's built-in movable tree CRDT, and synchronization uses Loro's binary
export/import format[^4]. The specification explicitly claims that CRDT-based
ID-addressing avoids the "shifting index" problem of path-based OT[^5].

### What was actually built

`mydenicek` implements its own **event DAG** with causal ordering via **vector
clocks**[^6], **deterministic topological replay** via Kahn's algorithm with
`EventId` tie-breaking[^7], and **hand-written operational transformation
rules** for every structural edit type (rename, wrap, unwrap, delete, copy)[^8].
Nodes are addressed by **path-based selectors** (`"items/0/name"`,
`"speakers/*/contact"`)[^9], not unique IDs.

### Justification

| Concern                              | Loro CRDT approach                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Custom OT approach (chosen)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Selector-based programming model** | Loro's LoroTree uses opaque TreeIDs. Mapping Denicek's path-based selector language onto ID-based addressing requires a translation layer that hides the tree CRDT's actual semantics.                                                                    | Selectors _are_ the native addressing mode. Wildcards (`*`), relative paths (`..`), and strict indices (`!0`) are first-class[^10]. The edit model operates directly on what the user sees.                                                                                   |
| **OT for structural edits**          | Loro handles concurrent tree moves natively, but does not expose general OT for arbitrary selector-rewriting structural edits (wrap, rename fields, update tags). The original Denicek paper itself uses OT, not CRDTs.                                   | Custom transformation rules give precise control over how `WrapRecord`, `WrapList`, `UnwrapRecord`, `UnwrapList`, `RecordRenameField`, and `RecordDelete` edits rewrite later concurrent selectors[^11]. This is exactly how the original Denicek paper achieves convergence. |
| **Replay and retargeting**           | Loro's undo manager groups commits by time window and its event system captures diffs as opaque patches. Replaying a recorded edit onto a different structural context (after wraps, renames) requires post-hoc selector fixup that Loro doesn't provide. | Every edit is an immutable `Edit` object with a `transformSelector` method[^12]. Replay walks the full causal history, transforming the replayed edit through every later structural change[^13]. This is the same correctness guarantee as the original Denicek OT.          |
| **Convergence proof**                | Loro guarantees strong eventual consistency for its built-in data types, but wrapping it with custom structural edits (tag changes, wraps, field renames) that aren't natively modeled by Loro containers makes the convergence argument fragile.         | Deterministic topological replay with explicit `resolveAgainst` OT[^14] means convergence is provable from the edit transform rules alone. The property tests and random fuzzer[^15] verify convergence across thousands of random concurrent-edit scenarios.                 |
| **Alignment with the Denicek paper** | The original Denicek system[^16] uses OT, not CRDTs. Replacing OT with CRDTs was the specification's hypothesis, but the Denicek editing model (selectors, structural transforms, replay) maps much more naturally to an OT event DAG.                    | The custom OT approach is a faithful reimplementation of the Denicek paper's own architecture, adapted for a causal DAG instead of a linear OT log.                                                                                                                           |
| **No external dependency**           | Loro is a Rust/WASM library with a Node.js binding. It constrains the runtime to environments with WASM support and adds ~2 MB to the bundle. Browser compatibility risks are flagged in the specification's own risk section[^17].                       | Zero external CRDT dependencies. The core library is pure TypeScript with no WASM, no native modules, and trivial bundle size. Runs on Deno, Node, and browsers without compatibility concerns.                                                                               |

**Bottom line:** The specification's CRDT hypothesis was a valid research
direction, but the Denicek editing model is inherently OT-shaped. Wrapping Loro
CRDTs with custom structural edits would have produced a leaky abstraction — the
selector-rewriting logic would need to be written anyway, but without the causal
ordering guarantees that a purpose-built event DAG provides. The current
architecture is simpler, has no external dependencies, and aligns with the
original Denicek paper.

| **FR-01** | Document as tree of nodes with unique IDs, kinds (element, value, formula, ref, action)                 | ⚠️ **Partial**            | Document is a tree of `RecordNode`, `ListNode`, `PrimitiveNode`, `ReferenceNode`[^18]. Nodes are addressed by **selectors** (paths), not unique IDs. There is no `formula` or `action` node _kind_ in the type system — formulas and actions are modeled as tagged records with specific field conventions[^19].                                                                                                             |
| **FR-02** | Element nodes: tag, attributes dict, ordered children                                                   | ✅ **Met (differently)**  | `RecordNode` has a `$tag` and named fields[^20]. `ListNode` has a `$tag` and ordered `$items`[^21]. Together they cover the element concept, split into record (named children) and list (ordered children) variants.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **FR-03** | Value nodes as `LoroText` with character-level splice                                                   | ❌ **Not met**            | `PrimitiveNode` stores `string                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **FR-04** | Node operations (addChild, deleteNode, moveNode, copyNode, updateTag, updateAttribute, spliceValue)     | ⚠️ **Partial**            | `add`, `delete`, `insert`, `remove`, `updateTag`, `copy`, `rename`, `wrapRecord`, `wrapList`, `set` are all implemented[^24]. **Missing:** `moveNode` (not in original Denicek paper) and `spliceValue` (character-level text editing).                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **FR-05** | Conflict resolution (concurrent moves → one location, LWW attributes, preserve both children, LWW tags) | ⚠️ **Partial**            | Concurrent adds preserve both children. Concurrent tag updates follow deterministic replay order (effectively LWW by topological position). Concurrent deletes/wraps/renames are handled by OT transform rules[^25].                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Every `Edit` has a `computeInverse(preDoc)` method[^27]. Two new edit types — `UnwrapRecordEdit` and `UnwrapListEdit` — serve as inverses for wrap operations[^28]. `Denicek` exposes `undo()`, `redo()`, `canUndo`, `canRedo`[^29]. Inverse events are normal DAG events, so remote peers converge automatically. **39 undo/redo tests** verify correctness[^30]. |
| **FR-07** | Automatic recording of mutations                                                                        | ⚠️ **Different approach** | Recording is done via the event DAG — every `commit()` call produces an `Event` with a stable `eventId`[^31]. Rather than accumulating diffs from an event subscription, events are stored directly and replayed by id.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **FR-08** | Replay recorded scripts on different targets                                                            | ✅ **Met**                | `replayEditFromEventId(eventId, target)` retargets edits[^32]. `repeatEditFromEventId(eventId)` replays at structurally-retargeted selector[^33]. `repeatEditsFrom(target)` replays multi-step scripts[^34].                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Formula nodes are tagged records (`$tag` starting with `"x-formula"`) with `operation` and `args` fields. The evaluator resolves `$ref` arguments, supports nested formulas, detects cycles, and enforces max recursion depth (100)[^36]. **41 formula engine tests + 9 integration tests**[^37].                                                                    |
| **FR-10** | Built-in formula operations (concat, sum, etc.)                                                         | ✅ **Met**                | 15 built-in operations registered at module load: `sum`, `product`, `mod`, `round`, `floor`, `ceil`, `abs`, `concat`, `uppercase`, `lowercase`, `capitalize`, `trim`, `length`, `replace`, `countChildren`[^38]. Custom operations can be registered via `registerFormulaOperation()`[^39].                                                                                                                                  |

References are automatically rewritten during structural edits (rename, wrap, unwrap)[^41]. The formula engine resolves `$ref` arguments to target values during evaluation[^42].                                                                                                                                |

The `repeatEditsFrom(target)` method replays all steps. This achieves the same end-user programming goal but without a dedicated `ActionNode` type or generalized-patch variable placeholders (`$0`, `$1`, ...).                                                                                                  |

| -------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Runtime**          | Node.js + npm              | **Deno 2.x**                                   | Built-in TypeScript, formatting, linting, testing. Fewer config files, simpler DX.     |
| **CRDT library**     | Loro (Rust/WASM)           | **None (custom OT)**                           | See Section 1.                                                                         |

## 4. Features Still Missing

These are the remaining features from the specification not yet implemented:

### 4.1 Character-Level Text Editing (FR-03: spliceValue)

**What's missing:** `PrimitiveNode` replaces values atomically. There is no
character-level collaborative text editing.

**Recommended approach:** Either:

- (a) Add a `TextNode` type backed by a text CRDT (e.g., Fugue/RGA), or
- (b) Use `registerPrimitiveEdit` with a
  `splice(index, deleteCount, insertText)` edit and transform indices through
  concurrent edits.

### 4.2 Generalized Patches with Variable Placeholders (FR-12 partial)

**What's missing:** The specification defines a `$0`, `$1`, ... variable
placeholder system for action nodes that makes recorded scripts portable and
context-independent. The current event-id-based replay works well but ties
scripts to specific event history.

## 5. Features Implemented Beyond Specification

The current implementation includes capabilities not specified:

| Feature                                | Description                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Property-based convergence testing** | Random fuzzer and property tests verify convergence across thousands of random edit scenarios[^52]             |
| **Managed-copy OT**                    | `CopyEdit` creates mirror edits that propagate concurrent changes to copy targets[^62]                         |
| **Event graph compaction**             | `compact()` collapses the DAG into a new initial document once all peers have acknowledged the frontier[^63]   |
| **Strict index segments**              | `!0` notation preserves list coordinates across concurrent insertions[^64]                                     |
| **Reference integrity**                | References are automatically rewritten during structural edits; deletions of referenced nodes are blocked[^65] |

## Confidence Assessment

- **High confidence:** The architectural comparison and requirement mapping are
  based on thorough reading of both the specification LaTeX source and the full
- **High confidence:** The architectural comparison and requirement mapping are
  based on thorough reading of both the specification LaTeX source and the full
  `mydenicek` implementation.
- **High confidence:** Undo/redo and formula engine statuses are verified by 337
  passing tests.
- **High confidence:** The missing features list is minimal — most specification
  requirements are now implemented, including action node rendering as buttons.
